// SeqSlotManager — complete host-side state for each concurrent serving slot.
//
// Companion of PagedKvPool: the pool hands out sequence handles and physical
// blocks; this class owns everything else a slot needs between admission and
// retirement — the pool-handle lifecycle (including every error path), the
// admission arithmetic (context clamp, prompt reservation, and rolling decode
// headroom), on-demand block allocation, per-slot sampler/RNG/penalty-history
// state, and the position counters.
//
// It deliberately owns NO device state. Prefill/decode allocation returns
// physical rows and block-table deltas as plain vectors. Prompt, KV ownership,
// sampler, and progress live together here; the scheduler keeps
// only its coarse request phase.
//
// Not thread-safe; the single scheduler thread is the only caller.
