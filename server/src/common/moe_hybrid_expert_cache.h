// Device cache for streamed MoE experts.
//
// Experts that neither owner stack holds are read from the model file on
// demand. This cache keeps a fixed pool of expert slots on one GPU: gate, up
// and down are three stacked [.., .., n_slots] tensors, so a layer's streamed
// routes run as one MUL_MAT_ID graph over slot ids, exactly like an owner
// stack. Slots are recycled least recently used first.
//
// Misses are loaded by a small pool of loader threads: each copies an expert
// out of the file mapping into its own pinned staging buffer and uploads it on
// its own stream, so reading one expert overlaps uploading another. Callers
// can stage a layer's misses early and prefetch predicted experts of a later
// layer; both only change when bytes move, never which experts are computed.
// So does the warm start, which fills the empty pool after load with the
// experts a usage profile ranks highest. A long prefill loads in bulk mode
// (set_bulk): direct reads that bypass the page cache, recycled within half
// the pool, so the decode working set and the page cache survive it.
